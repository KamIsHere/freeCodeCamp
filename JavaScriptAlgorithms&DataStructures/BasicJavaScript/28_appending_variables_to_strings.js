/*
Basic JavaScript: Appending Variables to StringsPassed
Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals( += ) operator.

Example:

var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;
ourStr is now "freeCodeCamp is awesome!"
Set someAdjective and append it to myStr using the += operator.
*/

// Change code below this line

var someAdjective = "Awesome!!!";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";

myStr += someAdjective;
